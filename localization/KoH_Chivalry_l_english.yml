 chivalry.1.t: "The Peasants of the Realm"
 chivalry.1.d: "Being raised as a lord, I had no difficulties getting the basic needs of life. I always knew though that some had to pay the price for that. Every season, the serfs of this land work hard, yet they're only rewarded with their lives being spared. For a lord like me, this comes as natural, since the powerful rein the weak, but is that really how a ruler should be? Should his subjects work hard day and night only for protection, which might not even be provided?"
 chivalry.1.a: "The poor must be rewarded for their work."
 chivalry.1.b: "That is the nature of life, the strong reins the weak."
 
 chivalry.2.t: "An Unexpected Duel"
 chivalry.2.d: "As I walk down the streets of my capital, I hear a voice. 'You there!', a man yells, whilst drawing out his sword. 'What do you want?', I respond. 'I heard you're [ROOT.Char.GetNameNicknamed], an exceptional warrior, so I'm here to fight you for glory'. Both of us stare at one another intensely, as if a fight is about to break out."
 chivalry.2.a: "If you wish for that duel, then prepare."
 chivalry.2.b: "I got no time to waste to people like you."
 
 chivalry.3.t: "The Duel"
 chivalry.3.d: "As we both draw our weapons, I realize a weakness in my opponent's defense. Before I have time to react though, my opponent charges in, catching me off-guard. Before I realize it, I find myself on the defensive, unable to deal any blows to my opponent. What shall I do?"
 chivalry.3.a: "I gotta counter-attack."
 
 chivalry.4.t: "Victory"
 chivalry.4.d: "The fighting continues on. Both of us exchange blow after blow, hoping to defeat one another. Suddenly, I see an opening for an attack. As I slash into it, my opponent takes a step back and yells 'I yield!'. 'It seems I have been bested by you', he tells to me."
 chivalry.4.a: "Good duel my friend."
 chivalry.4.b: "I shall not take light this challenge."
 
 chivalry.5.t: "Defeat"
 chivalry.5.d: "The fighting continues on. As we keep exchanging blows, I feel like I'm losing more and more stamina, whilst my opponent remains unshaken. The duel has developed into a fight for my survival. The clash of steel, and the ferocity of my opponent keeps me from going into the offensive. Suddenly, he slashes into me, knocking me on the ground."
 chivalry.5.a: "I yield!"
