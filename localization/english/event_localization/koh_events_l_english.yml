 richard.bride.t:0 "A Bride for Prince Richard"
 richard.bride.desc:0 ""The matter is settled," declares my father, King Henry, jabbing a meaty finger into the table. "This was decided when Alys was a wee chit. The princess has no defects. Indeed, she is comely and well-shaped." \n\nI grimace at the lecherous quality of his voice. The girl he speaks of is Princess Alys, sister to the King of France, my… Philippe. In a quiet corridor, Philippe laughs at me. "Pick a woman and marry her. I did it; it is not so hard. Better still, pick a girl who does not yet know her own mind. My sister will be pliable enough." \n\nThis pains me. "It is not so simple." \n\n"Is it not? Oh, do not sulk.""
 richard.bride.a:0 ""Perhaps you are right.""
 richard.bride.a.tt:0 "Choose between your brides."
 richard.bride.b:0 "I cannot."
 richard.bride.b.tt:0 "Commit to a life without a wife."
 richard.bride.2.t:0 "A Question of a Wife"
 richard.bride.2.desc:0 "Alys and I have been betrothed since her infancy. We have always been friends, and understand one another. But I have heard whispers that my father has taken her to his bed. Worse, that she has given him a stillborn. \n\nMy mother, from behind locked doors, offers me a second choice. A princess of Navarre, said to be pious and sweet. But Philippe will be hurt if I reject his sister."
 richard.bride.2.a:0 "I choose Alys of France."
 richard.bride.2.b:0 "I choose Berengaria of Navarre."
 richard.bride.3.desc:0 "My poor Richard has been in a terrible mood since I married young Isabella. To make matters worse, his parents are pressuring him into choosing a wife. He looks so gloomy that I must cheer him. I say, "Pick a woman and marry her. I did it; it is not so hard. Better still, pick a girl who does not yet know her own mind. My sister will be pliable enough." \n\nNow I’ve wounded him.  "It is not so simple," he sighs.\n\nThere are things we must not speak. I laugh nervously. "Is it not? Oh, do not sulk.""
 richard.bride.3.a:0 ""Let us tie our fortunes together.""
 richard.bride.3.b:0 ""Do whatever you think is best.""
 richard.bride.4.t:0 "The Matter of My Heir"
 richard.bride.4.desc:0 "Philippe is baffled. "You need an heir," he argues. "Soon you will be a king yourself. How long can you expect to play this game?" \n\nMy heart is light, as though an enormous burden has been lifted from my shoulders. "I have a natural son. I called him Philip. One son is enough for me, enough for England." \n\nHe runs his fingers over my lips. "I know too well the burden of being an only son. A bastard will have it twice-worse, even one so handsomely named.""
 richard.bride.4.a:0 ""You know how I feel.""
 richard.bride.4.b:0 ""Perhaps this is too much.""
 richard.bride.5.t:0 "An Heir for Richard"
 richard.bride.5.desc:0 "Surely he cannot mean to remain unwed for my sake? Such a grand gesture! Guilt prickles at me. "You need an heir," I argue. "Soon you will be a king yourself. How long can you expect to play this game?" \n\nThe corner of his mouth tilts in a smile. "I have a natural son. I called him Philip. One son is enough for me, enough for England." \n\nI run my fingers over his lips, surpressing a flash of jealousy. Is it for the son I so need, or for the woman who has borrowed my place in his bed? "I know too well the burden of being an only son. A bastard will have it twice-worse, even one so handsomely named." \n\n"You know how I feel.""
 richard.bride.5.a:0 "God help me, I feel the same."
 richard.bride.5.b:0 "I cannot be the source of this."
 richard.bride.6.desc:0 "Richard chooses his bride."
 richard.bride.6.a:0 "Go with the historical choice."
 world_buffing.t:0 "Buff the world!"
