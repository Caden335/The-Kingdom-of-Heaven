 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.1.t: "The Lion in Winter"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.1.d: "--Richard standing opposite a portrait of his brother, Henry, and his mother--\nHenry, my brother, is no more. Infected by diseases, I find it hard to believe. Only ten days ago we were locked in a skirmish against each other. Despite that, I do feel remorse for his passing.\nI had marched behind him against our own father once, years ago, when our father had denied him sovereignty to rule independently. It was long and we lost and our mother had to pay the price for it. But that war broke you, brother. It broke you and you bowed down to him. \nBack then, I didn’t know what had given you the strength to go against our father, but I do now. It is also what gave me the strength to not bow down to you. Aquitaine is my domain by our mother’s will. I will not bow down to anyone who doesn’t respect my land.\nThis war with my brother has left its mark on me as well. My granaries are running dry, my men exhausted and my defenses in ruins. It is time, I do something about them."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.1.a: "Shall we rebuild defenses?"
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.2.t:0 "News from Paris"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.2.d:0 "News arrived today from Paris, my brother, Geoffrey, has died in a jousting tournament. My father will be quick to take control of Brittany now, and Constance and Geoffrey’s unborn child will become his political tools. \nI have evidence that suggests Geoffrey might have helped Henry invade my lands three years ago. And sometime before that, they may have fought each other. It seems the only friend he ever had was Philip, the king of France, who, after Geoffrey’s death, himself has set his eyes on controlling Brittany."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.2.a: "An then, there were two"
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.3.t:0 "Prince Lackland"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.3.d:0 "Father has all but legitimized John, my youngest kin, as his successor, and his favourite child. The boy, who has barely ever seen battlefields, let alone leading armies or holding titles, will be crowned king, over me if Henry has his way.\n\nPerhaps it was expected, John has always been loyal to him. \n\nPerhaps, this has been my doing, having crossed swords with my father several times over the years. \n\nBut he must understand why I opposed him. I have only ever done so, when he would try to take from me; what was rightfully mine."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.3.a: "I must proceed diplomatically"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.3.b: "Is it not expected of a king? He must see that. I hope."
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.4.t:0 "A Little Place in France"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.4.d:0 "The sanctions on my domain are increasing by the day. Earlier I had hoped, perhaps father had proclaimed John as his successor to command respect from me. But now it is becoming increasingly clear he has no affection for me left in his heart.\n\nAquitaine was entrusted to me by mother in her absence. I have earned the loyalty of its people by defending it countless times. And I have made the right to call it mine. How can he command me to concede this land to John?"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.4.a: "He can take it"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.4.b: "Via the rights of Eleanor, Aquitaine is mine!"
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.5.t:0 "Odds"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.5.d:0 "Though I do not wish that it comes to that, it might be inevitable that I may have to go to war against father. \n\nFather’s acquisition of Brittany bore fruit. \nBrittany and the Duchy of Normandy are directly under his control and will rally their forces to him. \n\nAdvisors had convinced me to write to the king of Scotland, but I am hesitant. He had supported my brothers and me when we rebelled against our father, a decision that led him to heavy losses in land and possessions. As I am mostly dependant on my forces of Aquitaine, Anjou and Poitiers, it will be necessary to grab any further extra support."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.5.a: "Look for more supporters?"

 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.6.t:0 "A Clash of a Pride"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.6.d:0 "Rumours have been heard that soldiers have been sighted moving to forts in large numbers in Brittany. \nThey bear my father’s banners. \nCould he be preparing to attack me? Or is it a form of provocation? \nPerhaps, if I attack before they ready the forts, I could find his troops in disarray. \nBut in his case, it’s never that simple. Father is a great military tactician, and these rumours could have been his own doing."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.6.a: "A Lion moves First and Fast"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.6.b: "Rumors are just rumors, let him attack first if he dares."
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.7.t:0 "1187, Jerusalem" #Someone reading this please make this not as bad as it is, can be made much better
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.7.d:0 "Jerusalem and the holy land has fallen to Saladin, and the Pope has summoned all the knights bound by oath. It calls for me too. Another crusade is on the way. Only I stand between Aquitaine and my father, King Henry II of England. If I leave for the Holy Land, Aquitaine and Anjou will inevitably fall, and I'd never be able to return."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.7.a: "Glory to God! We shall travel to holy land!"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.7.b: "But if Henry attacks, I’ll be gone."

 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.8.t:0 "Swordplay Before Lunch"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.8.d:0 "Glad am I that I took to Godfrey’s training, for it might save my life! Parrying each blow from the man at my front, I lure him into making a swing just too low, giving me an opening. I deflect his sword and project my blade in the weak point between his mail and helmet. He falls. \n\nI take a moment to glance in the chaos. A big german fights to his last breath with two crossbow bolts protruding his body. Godfrey in his pursuit had been shot, too. Still he keeps his mount and swings, cleaving the skull of Puiset - killing him instantly."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.8.a: "A fitting end!"

 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.9.t:0 "Swordplay Before Lunch"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.9.d:0 "Glad am I that I took to Godfrey’s training, for it might save my life! I parry each blow, but my opponent is calculated and strong. My fingers ring numb. Suddenly he does not advance with his sword but with his shoulder, and I overbalance, falling flat on my back. My sword lands several feet out of reach. \n\nI am certain that this is my last moment. A certain particular hospitaller knight appears on horseback, fast as the light on his steed, and glistening in the sunrays like an angel from above. Without flair or notice, the Hospitaller separates the head from the body of the man standing above me. I catch my breath; the man salutes and turns to the chase. \n\nPuiset is dead by Godfrey’s sword. We have won, but at a steep cost-- three quarters of our friends are lost, and Godfrey is badly wounded."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.9.a: "My back!"
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.10.t:0 "The Long Italian Road"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.10.d:0 "We moved slowly throughout Italy, frequently stopping to tend to the injured of our party, such as my father, Godfrey. Eventually, we had come across a large pilgrim camp filled with Pilgrims, Knights, Cleryymen from the large stretches of Europe, It would be here that I'd meet a man called Guy of Lusignan for the first time. He was shocked to meet Godfrey and me, for nobody knew Godfrey had a son. Others of my party informed me after, for Guy would inherit Ibelin naturally after Godfrey. We would rest a night in this camp before continuing to Messina."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.10.a:0 "Dear God above, I pray for his health"
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.11.t:0 "Messina, Port to the Holy Land"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.11.d:0 "Messina, Port to the holy land - Located in Scilly, a short ferry from mainland Italy, stood firm and busy with life; filled with many from the pilgrim camps of before, now with hundreds of Italian merchants from Scilly and the various Merchant Republics around. \nWalking the streets filled with the construction of new trade center's, buildings for banking, ports and even new ships. Walking further downtown into the walled city, pushing past various lords with their crusader armies; ready for the holy land, our party settled in the Scillian Hospitaller Barracks where we wished to have Godfrey treated. We would need to wait a few days for our departure anyways, so no lost time."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.11.a:0 "A few more days, then Jerusalem..."

 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.110.t:0 "Rise" 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.110.d:0 "It was the night before we were set to sail from Messina, I was asleep and awoke to one of Godfrey's close companions - The Hospitaller Knight. He rushed me to a nearby chappel within the barracks, within stood my father, as pale in the face as ever. "Get on your knees," said the hospitaller, and I did as he commanded; Godfrey stood with support from two knights, and said \n\n"Be without fear, in the face of your enemies - be brave and upright that God may love thee and speak the truth always even if it leads to your death. Safeguard the helpless and do no wrong - That is your oath, rise a knight, and a baron of Ibelin." Godfrey then with the last of his energy, grabbed my hand and placed a noble ring, handing me also his sword of fine steel then collapsing into my arms and into my ear said: "Defend the King, if the king is no more.....protect the people". And with that, Godfrey of Ibelin passed away from his wounds... "
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.110.a:0 "Father...."

 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.12.t:0 "The Sea of fate"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.12.d:0 "It's been days since the departure from Messina, and I hadn't stopped thinking of Godfrey for a second; imagining life if he had stayed in France when I was a child, my life, if he took me along to Ibelin 20 years prior or even now if Godfrey was alive to show me the Holy Land as he intended now, the seas until now, were calm and steady but with each increasing hour, the waves grow in strength. \n\nThese would continue, and perhaps it was fate, but the next thing I'd remember was the call of the quartermaster to brace for the wave. "
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.12.a:0 "HOLD O......"
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.13.t:0 "The Sands"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.13.d:0 "It had felt like my back splintered in two, awaking from the hot sand below me and the sun above, I had lived, washed up with the shipwreck alone, well mostly alone...A fine steed had also survived, although in releasing it from the debris, it left me in the dust as it ran off into the distance. \nI spent the next hour in search of fresh water and, surprisingly did - turns out the horse from earlier also did allow me to mount her. \nIn the following minutes, I saw two mounted figures riding over towards me. "
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.13.a:0 "Oh dear."
