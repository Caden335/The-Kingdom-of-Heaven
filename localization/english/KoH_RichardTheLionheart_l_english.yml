 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.1.t: "The Lion in Winter"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.1.d: "--Richard standing opposite a portrait of his brother, Henry, and his mother--\nHenry, my brother, is no more. Infected by diseases, I find it hard to believe. Only ten days ago we were locked in a skirmish against each other. Despite that, I do feel remorse for his passing.\nI had marched behind him against our own father once, years ago, when our father had denied him sovereignty to rule independently. It was long and we lost and our mother had to pay the price for it. But that war broke you, brother. It broke you and you bowed down to him. \nBack then, I didn’t know what had given you the strength to go against our father, but I do now. It is also what gave me the strength to not bow down to you. Aquitaine is my domain by our mother’s will. I will not bow down to anyone who doesn’t respect my land.\nThis war with my brother has left its mark on me as well. My granaries are running dry, my men exhausted and my defenses in ruins. It is time, I do something about them."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.1.a: "Shall we rebuild defenses?"
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.2.t:0 "Unexpected Visitors"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.2.d:0 "I am a different man now, a man without reason, a man without a wife or child. If I were another man, I might have sought God, but I think God has abandoned this place. Grief gnaws at me; work is a balm. The singlewomen cast their eyes in my direction, but I do not look back.\n\nIt is a day like any other. The bishop has requested my wrought work for his cathedral in Chartres. At mid-afternoon I break, feeling as though my flesh is cooking in the sweltering forge. I will resume when the air is cooler, and plan to work long into the night. My apprentice peeks his head around the door, looking tense. He tells me that the king’s party has been seen on the road heading for our small settlement, escorting knights who have returned from the Levant. I am profoundly confused, but make some reply about them wanting to see the makings of the grand church."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.2.a: "What do they want? There are no heretics here!"
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.3.t:0 "A Sword for a Knight"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.3.d:0 "A squire to the Crusaders awakens me in the dead of night.  The eldest one in their party has returned from the castle of my lord having heard good things about my steel.\n\nThe old knight requests a specialized sword and offers me its particular diagram. It does not surprise me when I learn he is the natural brother of my lord; the quality of his speech suggests a man who would belong in court, even if his bearing demonstrates he is most comfortable in armor. While I pour over the pages of design, I catch him staring at me with an expression I cannot place. Is it… fondness? Whatever it is, he makes me uneasy.\n\nHe turns as though he will leave, and stops, abruptly admitting that he knew my namesake, the old blacksmith. Softly, he adds he knew my mother. He came all this way with the purpose of confession. My insides seize, imagining that he took my sweet mother by force, but he speaks with such kindness of her memory. My father died years ago, yet this man now claims me to be his son, and offers a place for me with him in Jerusalem.\n\nHere there is a grave that I must tend. I turn him away. He says in parting, "I am sorry for your troubles. God protect you. Jerusalem is easy to find. You come to where the men speak Italian… then continue until they speak something else. We go by Messina. Good-bye.""
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.3.a: "What does Jerusalem have for me? Nothing."
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.4.t:0 "Raging Fires"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.4.d:0 "I put my anger into the steel. Was the crusader my father? Would a man of his rank and prestige speak falsely? Had my antagonizing brother known this truth? As if summoned by this thought, Michel appears. Immediately, he drives at me. "The village does not want you! When the old lord is dead, they will drive you out. When the bishop is dead, it is certain."\n\n"And you take my property?" My response comes quickly to my tongue. We have had this fight before. Our late father-- the man I thought of as my father-- had seen that Michel’s talents lay one way and mine another.\n\nHe cringes. "The Church."\n\n"You." I wish to hear none of it. He has been happy enough to take the salary from the old lord, to enjoy the improved status of a cleric, but evidently that is not enough.\n\n"They would have taken you to Jerusalem. Away from... all this." He wheedles, increasingly excited, "I arranged it. I had them come here. I swear to you... you will have no peace so long as you stay here. No man ever needed a new world more. Imagine your sin and pain erased. All." I put a hammer to another glowing hot billet. Each is pounded thin enough to resemble its final form. Usually I make scrollwork for the bishop. Today, I make swords.\n\n"If you take the Crusade... you may relieve your wife's position in Hell. I-- I put it delicately. She was a suicide. She is in Hell." I pull the form from the forge to quench it. My stomach churns. He slips close enough that I can smell his foul breath when he jeers: "Though what she does there without a head..."\n\nReflected in the light of the forge I see gold glinting at his throat. I know to whom that cross belonged. I made it for her myself. My blood boils! God! The billet is in my hand. I drive it straight through him. My brother gurgles and screams as he falls into the open forge. His clothes catch, he flails-- I think only to save a piece of my wife. I reach in for the cross, grasp it so tightly the flesh of my palm boils, endeavor to rip it from the thong strung around his neck. Michel is lifted free by my efforts-- wild-eyed in death. He had mutilated her, stole from her shroud, lied to and manipulated me. I feel oddly calm as my brother’s death throes set fire to my shop.\n\nHe was right about one thing: no man ever needed a new world more. Before the alarm is raised, I unhitch my horse and flee."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.4.a: "..."
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.5.t:0 "Pursuing Godfrey"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.5.d:0 "Night has fallen on the French countryside. It is nearly my fifth day riding since my departure from town, and despite my horse's speed I have yet to run into the crusading party. I decide to take a night off from sleeping beneath the common larch and pay dearly for a night within a highway inn.\n\nIn the morning, I move into the inn's communal tavern, a place jostling with folk from all over. Knights, probable bandits, would-be adventurers, and locals-- I question many, as discreetly as I can manage. A few have heard of my quarry, and I learn that they have passed this way.\n\nThere grows a commotion from without. A few of the more questionable guests duck toward the back passage. Through the front come two knights bearing the banners of Chartres, seeking the arrest of "Balian, Blacksmith of Chartres, son of his namesake!" Slowly I move, keeping to the wall, kicking myself that I had not moved sooner, and grateful only that none here could connect that name to this face.\n\nAnother convoy of banner knights is arriving as I saddle my horse. I take its lead and we walk for the first quarter mile. When I am finally out of sight I ride as fast and hard as the road will allow -- I have to make distance between myself and these knights."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.5.a: "Ride Faster!"

 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.6.t:0 "Sparring After Breakfast"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.6.d:0 ""Have you come to kill me?" The man Godfrey -- lately my father-- asks wryly, as I finally catch up with the group. \n\nNo, I say, but there is blood on my hands. This, he agrees, we had in common. Was it true then that in Jerusalem the sins of a man could be purged? That there might be some relief for my late wife? This, he did not know, but offered to help me discover.\n\nMy new companions are like none I’ve ever met. I had fought in war before, and thought I knew it. I had built great engines of siege. That experience paled in comparison to a few weeks training with Godfrey and his men. \n\nOn a morning like any other, frost nipping the air, we break camp in Toulouse, perhaps a day from the border. Just as Godfrey and I are taking the final swings of our sparring match, we hear hoofbeats on the forest path. \n\nAtop a horse, and backed by four other knights, is Hugues de Puiset, the son of the old lord of Chartres, acting as his father’s sheriff. "Uncle,” he says, “I have come far for the blacksmith. I see he is in your care, but he has murdered a village priest -- By the order of the archbishop, I have the right to take him."\n\nI step forward to surrender, but Godfrey stills me with his hand. He winks at me, but his eyes are like ice. A dozen crossbowmen appear in the thick of the woods around us."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.6.a: "To the perimeter!"
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.7.t:0 "Ambush"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.7.d:0 "Within seconds of Godfrey's refusal, Puiset's men descend on the camp. They are not here to capture. They are here to kill. I get the feeling it is not just me they are after. \n\nMy father mounts his horse to pursue his nephew. The crusaders clash with the french soldiers in the thick of the trees behind me, and quickly I see a soldier charging towards me, weapon in hand."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.7.a: "Swing from above!"

 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.8.t:0 "Swordplay Before Lunch"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.8.d:0 "Glad am I that I took to Godfrey’s training, for it might save my life! Parrying each blow from the man at my front, I lure him into making a swing just too low, giving me an opening. I deflect his sword and project my blade in the weak point between his mail and helmet. He falls. \n\nI take a moment to glance in the chaos. A big german fights to his last breath with two crossbow bolts protruding his body. Godfrey in his pursuit had been shot, too. Still he keeps his mount and swings, cleaving the skull of Puiset - killing him instantly."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.8.a: "A fitting end!"

 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.9.t:0 "Swordplay Before Lunch"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.9.d:0 "Glad am I that I took to Godfrey’s training, for it might save my life! I parry each blow, but my opponent is calculated and strong. My fingers ring numb. Suddenly he does not advance with his sword but with his shoulder, and I overbalance, falling flat on my back. My sword lands several feet out of reach. \n\nI am certain that this is my last moment. A certain particular hospitaller knight appears on horseback, fast as the light on his steed, and glistening in the sunrays like an angel from above. Without flair or notice, the Hospitaller separates the head from the body of the man standing above me. I catch my breath; the man salutes and turns to the chase. \n\nPuiset is dead by Godfrey’s sword. We have won, but at a steep cost-- three quarters of our friends are lost, and Godfrey is badly wounded."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.9.a: "My back!"
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.10.t:0 "The Long Italian Road"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.10.d:0 "We moved slowly throughout Italy, frequently stopping to tend to the injured of our party, such as my father, Godfrey. Eventually, we had come across a large pilgrim camp filled with Pilgrims, Knights, Cleryymen from the large stretches of Europe, It would be here that I'd meet a man called Guy of Lusignan for the first time. He was shocked to meet Godfrey and me, for nobody knew Godfrey had a son. Others of my party informed me after, for Guy would inherit Ibelin naturally after Godfrey. We would rest a night in this camp before continuing to Messina."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.10.a:0 "Dear God above, I pray for his health"
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.11.t:0 "Messina, Port to the Holy Land"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.11.d:0 "Messina, Port to the holy land - Located in Scilly, a short ferry from mainland Italy, stood firm and busy with life; filled with many from the pilgrim camps of before, now with hundreds of Italian merchants from Scilly and the various Merchant Republics around. \nWalking the streets filled with the construction of new trade center's, buildings for banking, ports and even new ships. Walking further downtown into the walled city, pushing past various lords with their crusader armies; ready for the holy land, our party settled in the Scillian Hospitaller Barracks where we wished to have Godfrey treated. We would need to wait a few days for our departure anyways, so no lost time."
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.11.a:0 "A few more days, then Jerusalem..."

 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.110.t:0 "Rise" 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.110.d:0 "It was the night before we were set to sail from Messina, I was asleep and awoke to one of Godfrey's close companions - The Hospitaller Knight. He rushed me to a nearby chappel within the barracks, within stood my father, as pale in the face as ever. "Get on your knees," said the hospitaller, and I did as he commanded; Godfrey stood with support from two knights, and said \n\n"Be without fear, in the face of your enemies - be brave and upright that God may love thee and speak the truth always even if it leads to your death. Safeguard the helpless and do no wrong - That is your oath, rise a knight, and a baron of Ibelin." Godfrey then with the last of his energy, grabbed my hand and placed a noble ring, handing me also his sword of fine steel then collapsing into my arms and into my ear said: "Defend the King, if the king is no more.....protect the people". And with that, Godfrey of Ibelin passed away from his wounds... "
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.110.a:0 "Father...."

 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.12.t:0 "The Sea of fate"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.12.d:0 "It's been days since the departure from Messina, and I hadn't stopped thinking of Godfrey for a second; imagining life if he had stayed in France when I was a child, my life, if he took me along to Ibelin 20 years prior or even now if Godfrey was alive to show me the Holy Land as he intended now, the seas until now, were calm and steady but with each increasing hour, the waves grow in strength. \n\nThese would continue, and perhaps it was fate, but the next thing I'd remember was the call of the quartermaster to brace for the wave. "
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.12.a:0 "HOLD O......"
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.13.t:0 "The Sands"
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.13.d:0 "It had felt like my back splintered in two, awaking from the hot sand below me and the sun above, I had lived, washed up with the shipwreck alone, well mostly alone...A fine steed had also survived, although in releasing it from the debris, it left me in the dust as it ran off into the distance. \nI spent the next hour in search of fresh water and, surprisingly did - turns out the horse from earlier also did allow me to mount her. \nIn the following minutes, I saw two mounted figures riding over towards me. "
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.13.a:0 "Oh dear."
 
 KoH_RichardTheLionheart.14.t:0 "That is my horse!"
