 bookmark_hastings_normandyengland_desc:1 "William the Conqueror, a descendant of the Viking chief Rollo, became duke of Normandy at a very young age, a situation compounded by the fact that he was also a bastard. Early on he was constantly being used as a pawn by rival factions in the duchy, with a succession of his guardians being murdered. Once he reached adulthood, he faced years of warfare in order to take full control over his duchy, eventually emerging victorious. In 1066 he successfully invaded England to press a claim on the English throne. He spent the remainder of his reign consolidating and reforming his new kingdom in the face of sometimes fierce opposition."

He initiated his arduous campaign to crush his rivals and reconquer the lost territory in Italy to reform the Holy Roman Empire. The Magyars settled down in the Carpathian Basin and began to make their mark on the world as they conquered and pillaged their neighbors, becoming feared across Europe. In the north the Christians were trying to push into the Scandinavian Peninsula to start converting the pagan kings, but the Germanic faith still stood strong among the vikings. In Baghdad far to the south-east, the ancient Abbasid Caliphate that once ruled an empire stretching from Persia to Hispania finally fell to infighting, left only with the heartland of their former empire. And on the shores of Africa a new rival rose up in the form of the Fatimid Caliphate, ready to fill the vacant regions left behind by their adversary. \n\n#bold Who will stand victorious after this tumultuous time in history?#!"

Early in his reign he had to push back a rebellion by Duke Eberhard of Bavaria, as well as fight a war against Louis IV of West-Francia and Duke Gilbert of Lorraine. After securing peace in the war, Otto went on to fight for the Italian throne as well as push back the Hungarian threat in the east. In his later years, after his coronation as the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, he had to continue his struggles in Italy to keep his newfound empire under control. The Ottonian dynasty went on to control the empire for almost half a century after his death, until it finally ended with the demise of Henry II in 1024."

The heat of conflict has led a new charismatic leader to unite the crumbling sultanates into one, posing a great threat to the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. \n\nThe Kingdom of Jerusalem stands at the weakest point in its past 100 years. Only a nearly 50 years after its height, weakened by internal conflict, a king's power so quickly disregarded, the Leper King they call him.  \n\nWith the king's weak condition, many stand to abuse power in the Kingdom, the likes of the Templar Order and the Duke of Oultrejordain have continuously allied to plunder outside the borders of Jerusalem under what they call "Gods Will," ignoring the King's Truce."

A power struggle ensued between Shirkuh and Shawar after the latter was reinstated. Saladin, meanwhile, climbed the ranks of the Fatimid government by virtue of his military successes against Crusader assaults against its territory and his personal closeness to al-Adid. \n\nAfter Shawar was assassinated and Shirkuh died in 1169, al-Adid appointed Saladin vizier, a rare nomination of a Sunni Muslim to such an important position in the Isma'ili Shia caliphate. During his tenure as vizier, Saladin began to undermine the Fatimid establishment and, following al-Adid's death in 1171, he abolished the Fatimid Caliphate and realigned the country's allegiance with the Sunni, Baghdad-based Abbasid Caliphate, years later he would also rule over Syria, posing a new threat to the crusaders."

The earlier part of this era saw the great Germanic and Slavic migrations across Europe, with peoples such as the Goths and Lombards settling in Southern Europe, the Franks settling in Gaul and Saxons crossing the sea and settling in Britain. The Eastern Roman Empire was violently shaken by the pressure from the Goths and Avars, and fought bitterly with the ancient Persian enemy. The rise of Islam saw the Arabs conquering immense amounts of territory in the Middle East and North Africa, and in India several great dynasties vied for dominance, with the Rashtrakutas rising towards the end of the 8th century. In the steppes, the Khazars grew in power, and in Scandinavia things were about to change in a way that was to affect the entire continent..."

After a two-year power struggle, Karloman suddenly and conveniently fell ill and died, leaving Karl as sole ruler of the Franks.  He then proceeded to make the kingdom greater than ever before, conquering Saxony, Lombardy and other lands with equal measures of good strategic planning and ruthlessness. He was eventually crowned Holy Roman Emperor by pope Leo III, and his descendants were to rule large parts of Europe for a long time to come."
