 KoH_balians_adventure.1.t: "A Tale of Love"
 KoH_balians_adventure.1.d:0 "It has been a week since the-- the incident. The love of my life, the only woman in my life...\nWe were lovers ever since we had learned what it meant to love. We had grown up side by side, born under the hands of the same midwife and raised in the same tiny village. And as she tended our land, I would work in the smithy, my trade at heart. Unlike many other blacksmiths in France, I wholly owned my shop, as did my father before me. \nWe spent our days apart. I would toil for weeks before the forge to earn the moments lying by her side. In our nights together, we had been trying for a child. Just as it seemed it would be to no avail, she announced she had quickened. I think often of that calm, peaceful night, of that moment, of the light in her face and the tears of joy streaking down her cheeks. Then the memory falters, and I must remember the other tears.\nIn the following months, we were filled with days of joy which outshone any petty drugeries, to the point that I felt in my heart an intensity that I had yet to experience. As if I had fallen in love with her for the first time. Her belly grew, as did the child inside her, and active the child was, kicking away within her. She fashioned the swaddling, and I hired a basket for a cradle.\n\nPerhaps God did not intend for us to live this eternal bliss. One morning, the pains began. Under those same wizened hands of the midwife, the child came, but it did not draw breath. From that very moment on, my wife was never the same. From morning to night without a meal to eat, nor a word to speak, she had no more love nor care to give. People whispered of the stillborn, of the Devil in our midst.\nPerhaps I abandoned her, when I returned to the familiar heat of my forge. Our cottage, I thought at the time, was more than I could bear. So it was that the neighbor found my wife with the rope around her neck..."

 KoH_balians_adventure.2.t: "The Kings Army"
 KoH_balians_adventure.2.d: "It had been a day like no other; I had awoken to the bright rays of the sun, I had gotten up and went to work at the Smith, the local sheriff had requested me a dozen fine swords for the nobleman in the nearby Fort - and I had gone to work like always. I was a different man now, a man without reason, a man without a wife nor child - normally, this would make the average man seek God in unconventional ways, but I would put my grief into my work, I was a different man now, for now, I put my everything into my work - I had no motivation to work hard for another woman, but my motivation came at making my work better.\nIt was now about mid-day, with the ever hot sun combining with the smithy's hot coals to make my day even more of the sweaty mess it was becoming, but that isn't anything out of the ordinary for a village out in the fields of France.\nThe village life was calm and peaceful, which added on to everyone's sense of tenseness when we all collectively heard the thousands of thunderous claps in the far distance, and for nobody for what had caused such, and those questions lead to even more when we had learned them to be caused by the Kings army, heading for our small settlement.\nFor a village so far out, off the King's road and away from anything relevant, for the King and his court to make a stop here along his journey, has left the others and I, profoundly confused, for the King was not alone but joined with veteran knights from around Europe and with a band of Experienced Crusader Knights.\nWhen they had come to a stop, many of the templar knights had been stationed by the King in the nearby Fort; and the King's Party and Army departed on the road...what made the other villagers and I most curious was the need for Templars to be stationed with the small local garrison, did they believe to be heretics hidden among us? For we would not know."
 KoH_balians_adventure.2.a: "They better not be a bother"
 
 KoH_balians_adventure.3.t: "Crusader Knights"
 KoH_balians_adventure.3.d: "The morning after, a group of the Crusaders had awoken me - the eldest one had requested a specialized sword and needed to talk with me in my blacksmith. \nWhile in conversation with this Knight, who was of the definite upper class, I chose my words carefully; a person of his influence could have me done quickly. \n\nAfter many hours of forging such a blade, he had arrived once more, I hadn't noticed him at first, but he had looked fondly upon the smith - like most lords of his status; probably with the intent to purchase my rightful lands. Instead, he had revealed something; he came here with the purpose of confession, not to confess to a priest like my step-brother, but to confess to me, long ago my step-brother had it in ingrained in my mind that my father died long ago, yet this man now claims me to be his son. \nHe came closer, to talk more personally, and wished that I should join in the Holy Land, a preposterous suggestion, and what did the holy land have for me? Nothing. Was I the most pious of men? Most likely not, but was a journey to the Levant worth it for a man like me? Again no. \nIf this man was my father, he had already been out of my life for long enough to which it mattered not to send him on his way, and so I did. \n\nAs he gathered his party of men and headed to leave - he had the last word to say, "I am sorry for your troubles.
 God protect you. Jerusalem is easy to find. You come to where the men speak Italian...then continue until they speak something else. We go by Messina. Good-bye." and with that, they were gone."
 KoH_balians_adventure.3.a: "What does jerusalem have for me? Nothing."
 
 KoH_balians_adventure.4.t: "Raging Fires"
 KoH_balians_adventure.4.d: "I put my anger into the steel. Was the crusader my father? Would a man of his rank and prestige speak falsely? Had my antagonizing brother known this truth? As if summoned by this thought, Michel appeared. Immediately, he drove at me. "The village does not want you! When the old lord is dead, they will drive you out. When the bishop is dead, it is certain." \n"And you take my property?" My response came quickly to my tongue. We had had this fight before. Our late father-- the man I thought of as my father-- had seen that Michel’s talents lay one way and mine another. \nHe cringed. "The Church."\n"You."\n I wished to hear none of it. He had been happy enough to take the salary from the old lord, to enjoy the improved status of a cleric, but now that was not enough. \n"They would have taken you to Jerusalem. Away from... all this." He wheedled, increasingly excited, "I arranged it. I had them come here. I swear to you... you will have no peace so long as you stay here. No man ever needed a new world more. Imagine your sin and pain erased. All." \nI put a hammer to another glowing hot billet. Each was pounded thin enough to resemble its final form. Usually I made wrought iron scrollwork for the bishop’s cathedral. Today, I made swords. \n\n"If you take the Crusade... you may relieve your wife's position in Hell. I-- I put it delicately. She was a suicide. She is in Hell."\nI pulled the form from the forge to quench it. My stomach churned. He slipped close enough that I could smell his foul breath when he jeered - \n"Though what she does there without a head..."\nReflected in the light of the forge I saw gold glinting at his throat. I knew to whom that cross belonged. I had made it for her myself. My blood boiled! God! The billet was in my hand. I drove it straight through him. My brother gurgled and screamed as he fell into the open forge. His clothes caught, he flailed-- I thought only to save a piece of my wife. I reached in for the cross, grasped it so tightly the flesh of my palm boiled, endeavored to rip it from the thong strung around his neck. Michel was lifted free by my efforts-- wild-eyed in death. He had mutilated her, stole from her shroud, lied to and manipulated me. I felt oddly calm as my brother’s death throes set fire to my shop.\nHe was right about one thing - no man ever needed a new world more. Before the alarm was raised, I unhitched my horse and fled."

 KoH_balians_adventure.5.t: "After Godfrey"
 KoH_balians_adventure.5.d: "Night had fallen on the French countryside. It was nearly my fifth day riding since my departure from town, and despite my horse's speed I had yet to run into the crusading party. I decided to take a night off from sleeping beneath the common larch and paid dearly for a night within a highway inn.\nIn the morning, I moved into the inn's communal tavern, a place jostling with folk from all over. Knights, probable bandits, would-be adventurers, and locals-- I questioned many, as discreetly as I could manage. A few had heard of my quarry, and I learned that they had passed this way.\nThere grew a commotion from without. A few of the more questionable guests ducked toward the back passage. Through the front came two knights bearing the banners of Chartres, seeking the arrest of "Balian, Blacksmith of Chartres, son of his namesake!" Slowly I moved, keeping to the wall, kicking myself that I had not moved sooner, and grateful only that none here could connect that name to this face.\nAnother convoy of Banner Knights was arriving as I saddled my horse. I took his lead and we walked for the first quarter mile. When I was finally out of sight I rode as fast and hard as the road would allow -- I had to make distance between myself and these knights."
 KoH_balians_adventure.5.a: "Ride Faster!"

 KoH_balians_adventure.6.t: "Sparring after breakfast"
 KoH_balians_adventure.6.d: "“Have you come to kill me?” The man Godfrey -- lately my father-- asked wryly, as i finally caught up with the group. \nNo, I said, but there was blood on my hands. This, he agreed, we had in common. Was it true then that in Jerusalem the sins of a man could be purged? That there might be some relief for my late wife? This, he did not know, but offered to help me discover.\nMy new companions were like none I’d ever met. I had fought in war before, and thought I knew it. I had built great engines of siege. That experience paled in comparison to a few weeks training with Godfrey and his men. \nOn a morning like any other, frost nipping the air, we broke camp in Toulouse, perhaps a day from the border. Just as Godfrey and I were taking the final swings of our sparring match, we heard hoofbeats on the forest path. \nAtop a horse, and backed by four other knights, was Hugues de Puiset, the son of the old lord of Chartres, acting as his father’s sheriff. "Uncle,” he said, “I have come far for the blacksmith. I see he is in your care, but he has murdered a village priest -- By the order of the archbishop, I have the right to take him."\nI stepped forward to surrender, but Godfrey stilled me with his hand. He winked at me, but his eyes were like ice. A dozen crossbowmen appeared in the thick of the woods around us. "
 KoH_balians_adventure.6.a: "To defences!"
 
 KoH_balians_adventure.7.t: "A Chaotic Battleground"
 KoH_balians_adventure.7.d: "Within seconds of Godfrey's refusal to hand me over, Hugh le Puiset's party of men descended on the camp - orders to kill on the mind \nMy father mounted his horse to pursue his cousin, the crusaders clashed with the french soldiers just outside the tents of the camp behind, and quickly I saw a solider charging ahead towards me, sword in hand."

 KoH_balians_adventure.8.t: "Swordplay before Lunch"
 KoH_balians_adventure.8.d: "Quick I took to Godfrey and the crusader's training; Parrying each continuous attack from the Frenchman at my front. I had lured him into making a swing just too low, prompting me the ability to deflect his sword and for me to project my blade between his Mail and Helmet, slicing his neck, letting him fall to the ground. \nI took a moment to glance in the chaos, a big german knight - fighting to his last breath as two crossbow bolts protrude his body, Godfrey in his pursuit had been shot himself but had cut in a swing of glory, the skull of Hugh le Puiset - killing him instantly."
 KoH_balians_adventure.8.a: "Perfect...."

 KoH_balians_adventure.9.t: "Swordplay before Lunch"
 KoH_balians_adventure.9.d: "Quick I took to Godfrey and the crusader's training; Parrying each continuous attack, but my opponent was calculated, and strong - I was hastily losing energy, and with a sudden shove matched with my footing, I fell flat on my back knocking my sword several feet out of reach. \nI was certain at this moment that it was it my last,  until a certain particular hospitaller knight appeared on horseback, fast as the light on his steed, and glistening in the sunrays like an angle from above, he without any further notice, separated the head from the body of the man standing above me. Looking around, Godfrey had killed Hugh le Puiset, getting himself shot twice with arrows, but we had won, but our reward for victory was having a quarter of our original men and a severely injured Godfrey.
