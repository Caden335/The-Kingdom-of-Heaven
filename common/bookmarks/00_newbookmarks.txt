#3rd bookmark
#This start is when the map starts not being fully correct and will need further edits in the titles files. For example k_rum was referred to as a liege but did not exist in the titles files itself. This is also when I found out that it appears a bookmark will not load if there are ANY history/character file errors as once I fixed all the issues in these files I could get later bookmarks to load.
