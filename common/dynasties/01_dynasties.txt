#ADDED DYNASTIES

#Paradox added the Bagrationi but not the Bagratuni even though the former is descended from the later. dynn_Bagratuni does exist as a cadet branch/new dynasty title which is just stupid on Paradox's part. 

10000100000 = {
	name = "dynn_Bagratuni"
	culture = "armenian"
}

#This existed but was marked as a Turkish dynasty???

25201 = {
	name = "dynn_Kvirikian"
	culture = "armenian"
}

#Taronites exists

101510 = {
	name = "dynn_Taronites"
	culture = "greek"
}

#Tornikes exists but isn't properly attached to even the Bagrationi. In CK3 starts with 70435 instead of 1232358 (probabably chars HIP added)

101146 = {
	name = "dynn_Tornikes"
	culture = "greek"
}

#made English to CoA's work right

106 = {
	name = "dynn_Plantagenet"
	culture = "english"
}

#END ADDED
